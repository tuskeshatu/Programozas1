# Abstract

This is a homework project made for the Budapest University of Technology and Economics Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics
Basics of Programming 1 subject. The scope of the project is to create a program in the C programming language, which demonstrates
my abilities and skills acquired during the semester.

The main motivation of the project was to create a C program, which uses some kind of shortest path algorithm. Since the project needed
to contain dynamic memory handling and some basic file handling too, I chose to create a basic map routing implementation. By no means
is this project perfect, but at least it doesn't have any memory leaks and I've learnt a lot doing it. I hope whoever reads this documentation
has some fun at least picking apart the one and only source file with lots of vulnerabilities, unreadable code and many other flaws.
